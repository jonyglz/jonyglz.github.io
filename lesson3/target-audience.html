        <h2>Audience</h2>
        <p>[The website is directed to everyone in the Preston, Soda Springs, and Fish Haven. It would also be useful for tourists
            planning to visit.]</p>

      <h3>Personas</h3>
      <p>[The first personas that I could identify for this site after
          studying the main occupations in Preston, ID were the sales workers. They are 
          the biggest sector in Preston. They being people that are usually working on a 
          9-5 shift. It is important for them to see the weather mainly if they work on door 
          sales.]</p>
        <p>[The second type of personas based on the datausa.io website for Soda Springs are the manufacturing workers.
            However, there is a portion of the population that does mining, quarrying and oil and gas extraction. So 
            it would be importat for them to know if the weather is favourable for their extraction duties.]</p>
